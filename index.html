          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I am an ambitious high school student at Hitachi Gymnasiet in Västerås, studying the
            technology program with a focus on programming and system development. I have strong IT
            skills and a passion for creating and solving problems, which has led to several
            projects in web development, design, and automation.
          </p>

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <p>
            Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on throughout my programming journey. Each one
            reflects my passion for problem-solving and development, whether in web design,
            automation, or game creation. Some projects are fully completed, while others remain
            unfinished due to time constraints or evolving interests. Regardless, they all serve as
            valuable learning experiences, and I look forward to revisiting and improving them as my
            skills continue to grow.

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>
            I may not have industry experience yet, but that hasn’t stopped me from diving deep into
            programming through personal projects and self-driven learning. From web development to
            automation and game design, I’ve worked on a variety of challenges that have
            strengthened my skills in problem-solving and software development. Through these
            projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience with languages like Python, JavaScript, and
            C#, while also developing a solid understanding of system development and IT. I’m always
            eager to learn and improve, and I look forward to applying my skills in a professional
            environment in the future.
